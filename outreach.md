# Outreach & SciComm

<div style="text-align: justify"><p style="font-size: 18px">
At our lab, we understand that sharing our results is as important as generating them. We actively promote science outreach and communication efforts among our members, targeting diverse audiences, with a primary focus on the general public, whose taxes significantly fund our research. Below are some of our recent participation activities: </p></div>

### Organizing [#SMBPlant2023](https://smbplant.quimica.unam.mx)

### Open Doors @ IBt - UNAM

*Disclaimer: Most of these activities were performed when I was at IBt-UNAM working with Dr. Svetlana Shishkova*

> Every two years at IBT-UNAM the doors are open for everyone to come see what we do in the lab.
> Here, some of my students made Cactus stamps, a photo gallery, live specimens showcase, and we
> even used augmented reality to take our visitors to the jungle in search of epiphytic cacti.

### Invited Speaker

> I was invited to the Autonomous University of Querétaro. We had a field trip to the campus Concá,
> visited part of the Sierra Gorda, and saw how the UAQ is working on sustainability. I had an interesting
> discussion with the students about how colonialism shaped botany, and how botany shaped empires.
