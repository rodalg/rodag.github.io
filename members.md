# Lab Members

## Current
- **Juan Manuel Palacios Corona**
  - Undegrad student at CIDC-UAEM. He is currently exploring cell cycle on roots with determinate growth.
- **Elsy Naomi Miranda Vargas**
  - Undegrad student at UPEMOR. She is with us in a temporary research stay, giving the first steps on exploring ribosome biogenesis in wild-type and mutant plants of _A. thaliana_

## Former
- **Joel Rodríguez Herrera**
  - _Research internship_ He was an undergrad student at CCG-UNAM. He worked on inferring transcriptional regulatory networks in the root apical meristem of dicot and monocot species.
- **Kenia Aislinn Galván Alcaraz**
  - _Graduated on Oct 2024_. She was working on RNA-seq and smallRNA-seq to explore the transcriptional regulation of determinate growth in _Carnegia gigantea_.
- **Julieta Olvera Berruecos**
  - _Graduated on Dec 2023_ Her project was focused on standardizing a protocol for High-molecular-weight DNA extraction from Cactaceae and other challenging species.
- **Yuleimi Corín Pacheco Blancas**
    * _Graduated on Dec 2022_. Corin's project was mainly focused on characterizing _Echinopsis mirabilis_ as a model species for Cactaceae, specifically for developmental and molecular studies.
- **Ramsés Uriel Albarrán Hernández**
    * _Graduated on May 2021_. Ramsés's project was focused on the phylogenetical analysis of the PLETHORA transcription factors, and their possible involvement in Cactaceae root determinate growth.
