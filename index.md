Our lab is focused on generating genomic resources for Cactaceae and xeric shrubland species. We are also on the look for new model organisms to facilitate the study of these species from a molecular and physiological standpoint. In addition, we aim to develop and standardize <i>in-vitro</i> cultivation, micropropagation, and developing experimental approaches to learn from desert and xeric species, which have naturally evolved resilience to abiotic stress, including water deficit and high temperatures.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px">Sharing this delightful snapshot of cherished colleagues —students, friends, and mentors— who have not only taught me about cacti and other resilient species but have also nurtured a deep fondness for them in my heart! </p>
